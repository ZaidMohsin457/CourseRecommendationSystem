# CourseRecommendationSystem
This project aims to develop a personalized recommendation system for students seeking online courses and
resources to enhance their learning experience. The system
leverages a Coursera dataset from Kaggle and simulates user
data to model realistic learning preferences. By employing
Random Forest Regressor and content-based filtering techniques,
the system predicts course ratings tailored to individual users
based on their educational background, preferences, and previous
performance. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the
methods, results, and implications of this system, demonstrating
its potential for scalability to various resource types, including
videos, articles, books, and more.
